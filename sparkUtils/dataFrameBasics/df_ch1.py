    The process of logical and physical DataFrame manipulation:
    The logical plan of transformations that we build up defines a lineage for the DataFrame so that
at any given point in time, Spark knows how to recompute any partition by performing all of the
operations it had before on the same input data

We do not manipulate the physical data; instead, we configure physical execution characteristics
through things like the shuffle partitions parameter that we set a few moments ago. We ended up
with five output partitions because that’s the value we specified in the shuffle partition. You can
change this to help control the physical execution characteristics of your Spark job
